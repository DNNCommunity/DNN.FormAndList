        Rendering methods are now reduced to DataGrid and XSLT. The option for predefined XSLT scripts was removed.
        The old scripts are no longer delivered with the module. If an existing instance still uses an old script,
        the script will be copied into the portal (folder XslStylesheet/UDT Legacy).

        <strong>Important for updates</strong><br />
        The switch to Form Pattern has an effect on how the form is rendered. CSS tweaks for the old form will certainly fail.
        Please <strong>test</strong> the new UI before upgrading.
    </li>
